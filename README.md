  <h1>Custom Voucher Design Generator</h1>
</div>

### What is this?

This project allows me to print vouchers with a customized design from any device (mobile/desktop) without using any app. I created this project because I was frustrated with the Microsoft Word app, which required a subscription and was not compatible with third-party apps. The app also ruined the design of my vouchers when I opened them with other apps. Moreover, creating vouchers on mobile was very time-consuming, especially when I was in school and needed to print one quickly.

Another challenge I faced was copying the voucher codes from Omada Controller to my custom design vouchers. To solve this problem, I wrote a script that scrapes the codes from Omada Controller and makes my copying process much faster.

Note: You can't use the script to scrape the voucher codes on mobile because mobile browsers don't have devtool.
